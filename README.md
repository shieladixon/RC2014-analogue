These are example programs that use the RC2014 dual analogue input module, built to run on cpm or classic machines.

## Etch-a-Sketch
A version of the classic drawing toy that is every bit as hard to use. It requires a pot connected to both analogue ports and a TMS module or TMS emulator on 98/99 or 08/09. Press C to 'shake' the screen and clear. What masterpiece can you create?

## OhSillyScope
Samples port A as quickly as possible and then displays the data in an oscilloscope style. Requires TMS module or TMS emulator on 98/99 or 08/09. Press a key to resample.

## Pong
The classic game, based on the home TV game versions of the '70s, mine was Binatone. I've added a colour option (the posh kids had a Grandstand console and a colour TV!) I've not been obsessive about the accuracy but it's reasonably close. Requires TMS module or TMS emulator on 98/99 or 08/09 and optionally an AY module on ports D8/D0 or A0/A1. If using the Why Emulator, jumper to MSX ports A0/A1
